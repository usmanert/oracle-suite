# Spectre CLI Readme

Spectre is an application run by relays. It updates Oracles contracts.

## Installation

To install it, you'll first need Go installed on your machine. Then you can use standard Go
command: `go install github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite/cmd/spectre@latest`

Alternatively, you can build Spectre using `Makefile` directly from the repository. This approach is recommended if
you wish to work on Spectre source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite.git
cd oracle-suite
make
```

## Configuration

To start working with Spectre, you have to create configuration file first. By default, the default config file location
is `config.hcl` in the current working directory. You can change the config file location using the `--config` flag.
Spectre supports HCL configuration format.

### Configuration reference

_This configuration is only a reference and not ready for use. The recommended configuration can be found in
the `config.hcl` file located in the root directory._

```hcl
# List of files to include. The files are included in the order they are specified.
# It supports glob patterns.
include = [
  "config/*.hcl"
]

# Custom variables. Accessible in the configuration under the `var` object, e.g. `var.feeds`.
variables {
  feeds = [
    "0x2D800d93B065CE011Af83f316ceF9F0d005B0AA4",
    "0xe3ced0f62f7eb2856d37bed128d2b195712d2644"
  ]

### Environment variables

It is possible to use environment variables anywhere in the configuration file. Environment variables are accessible
in the `env` object. For example, to use the `HOME` environment variable in the configuration file, use `env.HOME`.
