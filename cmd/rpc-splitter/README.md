# RPC-Splitter CLI Readme

RPC-Splitter is an Ethereum RPC proxy that splits a request across multiple endpoints, compares them against each other
to guarantee data integrity.

## Installation

To install it, you'll first need Go installed on your machine. Then you can use standard Go
command: `go install github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite/cmd/rpc-splitter@latest`

Alternatively, you can build RPC-Splitter using `Makefile` directly from the repository. This approach is recommended if
you wish to work on RPC-Splitter source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite.git
cd oracle-suite
make
```

## How it works

Using third-party RPC providers is convenient, but for tasks that require a high level of security, it makes the
security of the entire system dependent on that one RPC provider. The RPC Splitter helps to solve this problem.

The RPC Splitter works similarly to a proxy, but instead of forwarding the request to one server, it forwards it to
multiple servers and compares the results against each other, thereby guaranteeing data integrity.

Depending on the number of endpoints provided, the behavior of the RPC Splitter changes slightly. For one endpoint, the
value will be forwarded as is. For two endpoints, both responses must be identical. For three or more, one response may
be different.

## Supported methods

- `eth_blockNumber` - Returns the lowest block number that is equal to or greater than the last known block minus the
  value specified in the `--max-blocks-behind` argument.
- `eth_getBlockByHash`
- `eth_getBlockByNumber`
- `eth_getTransactionByHash`
- `eth_getTransactionCount`
- `eth_getTransactionReceipt`
- `eth_sendRawTransaction`
- `eth_getBalance`
- `eth_getCode`
- `eth_getStorageAt`
- `eth_call`
- `eth_getLogs`
- `eth_gasPrice` - Median value is returned. For two valid responses, a lower one.
- `eth_estimateGas` - Median value is returned. For two valid responses, a lower one.
- `eth_feeHistory`
- `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` - Median value is returned. For two valid responses, a lower one.
- `eth_chainId`
- `net_version`

If the method requires a block number, the `newest` and `pending` tags will be replaced with the latest block number
using the same algorithm as the `eth_blockNumber` endpoint. The `earliest` tag is not supported.

## CORS

It is possible to enable simple CORS support to allow using RPC-Splitter with tools such as Metamask. When CORS is
enabled, then the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header will always equal the `Origin` header from the request.
