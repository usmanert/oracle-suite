## Installation

To install it, you'll first need Go installed on your machine. Then you can use standard Go
command: `go install github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite/cmd/ghost@latest`

Alternatively, you can build Ghost using `Makefile` directly from the repository. This approach is recommended if
you wish to work on Ghost source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite.git
cd oracle-suite
make
```

## Configuration

To start working with Ghost, you have to create configuration file first. By default, the default config file location
is `config.hcl` in the current working directory. You can change the config file location using the `--config` flag.
Ghost supports HCL configuration format.

### Configuration reference

```hcl
ghost {
  # Ethereum key to use for signing price messages.
  ethereum_key = "default"

  # Specifies the interval in seconds between sending price messages.
  interval = 60

  # List of pairs to send price messages for.
  pairs = [
    "BTC/USD",
    "ETH/BTC",
    "ETH/USD",
  ]
}

# Ghost internally use Gofer to fetch asset prices. Gofer configuration is described in the Gofer README.
gofer {
  price_model "BTC/USD" "origin" {
    origin = "kraken"
  }

  price_model "ETH/BTC" "origin" {
    origin = "kraken"
  }

  price_model "ETH/USD" "origin" {
    origin = "kraken"
  }
}

ethereum {
  # Optional list of random Ethereum keys to use for signing. The name of the key is used to reference the key in other 
  # sections.
  rand_keys = ["key"]

  # Configuration for Ethereum keys. The key name is used to reference the key in other sections.
  # It is possible to have multiple keys in the configuration.
  key "default" {
    # Address of the Ethereum key. The address must be present in the keystore.
    address = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"

    keystore_path = "./keystore"

    # Path to the file containing the passphrase for the keystore.
    # Optional.
    passphrase_file = "./passphrase"
  }

  # Configuration for Ethereum clients. The client name is used to reference the client in other sections.
  # It is possible to have multiple clients in the configuration.
  client "default" {
    # RPC URLs is a list of Ethereum RPC URLs to use for the client. Ethereum client uses RPC-Splitter which compares
    # responses from multiple RPC URLs to verify that none of them are compromised. At least three URLs are recommended.
    rpc_urls = ["https://eth.public-rpc.com"]

    # Chain ID of the Ethereum network.
    chain_id = 1

    # Ethereum key to use for signing transactions.
    # Optional. If not specified, the default key is used, the signing is done by the Ethereum node.

# List of feed addresses. Only messages signed by these addresses are accepted.

  }

  # Configuration for the WebAPI transport. WebAPI transport allows to send messages using HTTP API. It is designed to 
  # use over secure network, e.g. Tor, I2P or VPN. WebAPI sends messages to other nodes using HTTP requests. The list of 
  # nodes is retrieved from the address book.
  # Optional.

    # Ethereum address book that uses an Ethereum contract to fetch the list of node's addresses.
    # Optional.

    }
  }
}

### Environment variables

It is possible to use environment variables anywhere in the configuration file. Environment variables are accessible
in the `env` object. For example, to use the `HOME` environment variable in the configuration file, use `env.HOME`.
