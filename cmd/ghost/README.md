## Installation

To install it, you'll first need Go installed on your machine. Then you can use standard Go
command: `go install github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite/cmd/ghost@latest`

Alternatively, you can build Ghost using `Makefile` directly from the repository. This approach is recommended if
you wish to work on Ghost source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chronicleprotocol/oracle-suite.git
cd oracle-suite
make
```

## Configuration

To start working with Ghost, you have to create configuration file first. By default, the default config file location
is `config.hcl` in the current working directory. You can change the config file location using the `--config` flag.
Ghost supports HCL configuration format.

### Configuration reference

```hcl
variables {
  # Custom variables. Accessible in the configuration under the `var` object, e.g. `var.feeds`.
  feeds = [
    "0x2D800d93B065CE011Af83f316ceF9F0d005B0AA4",
    "0xe3ced0f62f7eb2856d37bed128d2b195712d2644"
  ]
}

ghost {
  # Ethereum key to use for signing price messages.
  ethereum_key = "default"

  # Specifies the interval in seconds between sending price messages.
  interval = 60

  # List of pairs to send price messages for.
  pairs = [
    "BTC/USD",
    "ETH/BTC",
    "ETH/USD",
  ]
}

# Ghost internally use Gofer to fetch asset prices. Gofer configuration is described in the Gofer README.

### Environment variables

It is possible to use environment variables anywhere in the configuration file. Environment variables are accessible
in the `env` object. For example, to use the `HOME` environment variable in the configuration file, use `env.HOME`.
